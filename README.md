## 1. Candy Dataset Visual Analysis

### 1.1. Introduction

The essence of Halloween is straightforward: provide satisfying treats to those in costumes or face potential late-night tricks from unhappy visitors. To help avoid such mishaps and to guide your candy-buying decisions this season, an experiment was designed to determine the most favored Halloween candies. By setting numerous fun-sized candy varieties against one another, the collective preference of participants was used to rank them.

Though the exact identities of voters remain unknown, data reveals that 8,371 unique IP addresses participated in approximately 269,000 randomized matchups. While this doesnâ€™t qualify as a scientific survey, it offers a reasonable glimpse into popular candy preferences (Hickey, Laskowski, Chow, & Scherer, 2017).

## 2. OECD Secondary School Visual Analysis

### 2.1. Introduction

The secondary graduation rate refers to the projected proportion of individuals expected to complete secondary education during their lifetime. The data is categorized by gender and presented for both upper-secondary and post-secondary, non-tertiary education levels (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, n.d.).

## 3. Loan Analysis

### 3.1. Introduction

In this project, I explored the [LoanData.csv] dataset to understand credit behavior, borrower purposes, and loan performance outcomes through interactive visualizations. The primary goal was to interpret how loan purposes relate to final loan status â€” whether loans are paid, defaulted, or currently active.

Using Amazon QuickSight, I built a Sankey Diagram to map the flow between Loan Status and Purpose fields. This format clearly shows which loan purposes are most common, and how they correlate with repayment success.

## 4. SaaS Sales Analysis

### 3.1. Introduction

In this project, I analyzed the SaaS-Sales.csv dataset to uncover sales performance trends across time, industries, customer segments, and geographic locations. The objective was to evaluate growth behavior, detect high-performing markets, and identify strategic areas for improvement.

Using Amazon QuickSight, I built interactive visuals such as time series charts, donut breakdowns, Sankey diagrams, and geospatial maps to capture a multi-dimensional understanding of sales dynamics.
