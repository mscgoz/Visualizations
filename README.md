## 1. Candy Dataset Visual Analysis

### 1.1. Introduction

The essence of Halloween is straightforward: provide satisfying treats to those in costumes or face potential late-night tricks from unhappy visitors. To help avoid such mishaps and to guide your candy-buying decisions this season, an experiment was designed to determine the most favored Halloween candies. By setting numerous fun-sized candy varieties against one another, the collective preference of participants was used to rank them.

Though the exact identities of voters remain unknown, data reveals that 8,371 unique IP addresses participated in approximately 269,000 randomized matchups. While this doesnâ€™t qualify as a scientific survey, it offers a reasonable glimpse into popular candy preferences (Hickey, Laskowski, Chow, & Scherer, 2017).

## 2. OECD Secondary School Visual Analysis

### 2.1. Introduction

The secondary graduation rate refers to the projected proportion of individuals expected to complete secondary education during their lifetime. The data is categorized by gender and presented for both upper-secondary and post-secondary, non-tertiary education levels (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, n.d.).
